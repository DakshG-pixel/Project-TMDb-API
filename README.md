# Project-TMDb-API
For this project, I have used the TMDb (The Movie Database) API.
TMDb API enables you to find out the latest information about TV Shows, Movies and the biggest names in entertainment sector for a marvelous and fun TV/Movie watching experience.

# To Get Started
TMDb documentation link- https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started
After joining TMDb, you can easily generate a new developer API key using this link - https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api/request

# Libraries Used 
the python libraries used are requests and json.

# My Motivation for using TMDb API
* By collecting the data using TMDb API one can recommend TV Shows, Movies and all sorts of entertainment on the basis of userâ€™s affinity to specific genres, actors, likes and dislikes.
* We can find details about upcoming TV Shows and Movies.
* We can find what is the most popular and/ or exclusive/new content at a given time.
